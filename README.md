Today, Low-Earth-Orbit satellite constellations can allow fast and reliable global internet.
However, they are highly vulnerable to physical Denial of Service cyberattacks, which we aim to defend against.

We propose an innovative approach, using a Phased Array Antenna in Sub THz frequencies. Phased arrays can cancel interferences by beamforming the antenna (Adaptive Nulling). 
Sub THz frequencies allow higher data rates and narrower beams. We simulated our defensive algorithm using MATLAB and achieved excellent results.
Yet in reality, conditions aren’t perfect. Sub-THz beamwidth is narrower, therefore beamforming angular noise (∆θ°>0) may impair nullification. Our examination showed a sharp decrease in SNR for every deviation. 
For ∆θ=0.1°, our SNR was lower by -1.08 dB from the maximum 10dB. 
Our conclusion holds that Phased Array Antennas offer an excellent defense against satellite cyber-attacks. 

With that being said, more testing must be done in a real environment. 
We predict that under the described angular deviations our defensive proposal will greatly contribute to the satellite's defense.
